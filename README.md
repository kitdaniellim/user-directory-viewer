## Any decisions or trade-offs made

- Components are created from PrimeReact
- Modules vs Scenes approach
    - Modules are fully reusable and customizable components.
    - Scenes are pages that use modules that may also have their own components specific to the scene.
    - This adds a few extra steps to creating new components, but promises scalability and reusability as the application grows.
 
- Component-Based Architecture
    - Component Types, Hook Usage, Styles, and UI are all contained within the same component folder but in separate files.
    - Main benefit is code readability and organization, with extra effort and time as a tradeoff.
